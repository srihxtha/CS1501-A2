  Autocomplete is a very useful feature in cellphones, internet search engines, and other sources for users to find the word they are looking for in the available 
dictionary. For this assignment, we were tasked to create an automatic word-completion system that inserted a DLB and kept count of the score of a word based on 
how many times it was selected, as well as an algorithm that retrieved suggested words from the dictionary that was provided based on the prefix that the user 
inputted. 

The first task of the assignment was to insert a DLB trie that had the words from the dictionary in it, as well as a score field that kept track of how many 
times a word has been selected as a suggestion. Then, we had to be able to retrieve that score. I accomplished this by first creating a method called “add” which 
added all the words in the dictionary to the DLB trie. This went through every iteration, and traversed through siblings, children, and children’s siblings. Then,
I created a helper method call throughMethod which was very similar to the add method but this was meant to go through every word and see if it was viable based on
the user input. After this, I called the throughMethod in the notifyWordSelected method, which incremented the score of the word if it was selected. Finally, I 
called the throughMethod in another method called getScore which returned the score of the word. I then tested this with the A2test.java file that was provided
to make sure it was working properly.

The second task was to retrieve the word suggestions. I did this by first creating the helper class Suggestion to hold suggestions. In this class, I created a 
method called compareTo that takes in a suggestion and returns either 0, -1, or 1, based on what the score is. This will help to put the suggested words in 
descending order based on their scores. Then, I created the suggestion list with an arraylist. By calling the throughMethod again, if the word from the method was 
a valid word, it was added to the suggestions list, which was then returned. Finally, I recreated a retrieveWords method that took in the word, the suggestion list,
and the current node in the DLB. If the word was in the dictionary already, it and the score is added to the suggestion list and the recieveWords method is called 
recursively with the child and sibling. The last character in the word is also deleted so it isn’t counted multiple times. If the word is not currently in the
dictionary, it will be appended into the dictionary.

I had a couple issues debugging the program. The biggest issue was with part 2, especially when I had to figure out how to traverse through the nodes so that the
scores would increment properly, and that the right suggestions would appear. I also didn’t realize that we were supposed to make it so that you can add words to 
the dictionary if they are not already in it, which made my output different than the correct one. 

Based on a variety of factors including the number of words in the dictionary, the number of characters in a particular word or prefix, the number of matching word
suggestions, and the number of words in the alphabet, different aspects of the project have different worst-case runtimes. To begin with, the worst case runtime of
the insertion of the DLB trie is O(n), where n is the number of characters in the word. The worst case run time for both incrementing the score and returning it is
O(1). Finally, the worst case run time for retrieving the suggestions is O(n). 
In conclusion, this assignment was a challenging, but rewarding project. It taught me a lot about DLB trie’s and helped progress my programming skills.
